Notes:
+ We don't have an maximum on line length, commands in a pipe, or arguments 
  to a command. 

+ The redirect in and redirect out is check as per line basis and not 
  checked at each stage.

  e.g. a > e | b < c | d  is valid and redirecting in from c for stage ag
  and redirect out to e for stage d.
